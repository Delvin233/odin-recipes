    <h3>Description</h3>
    Have you wondered how Yam Ampesi is made? Stress not! I'm here to show you
    how it's made.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Yam</li>
      <li>Oil: Red or Vegetable</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Cocoyam leaves</li>
      <li>Boiled Eggs</li>
      <li>Fish and meat of any kind</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil the yyam till it becomes soft: the texture is on you!</li>
      <li>Boil and grind the cocoyam leaves the texture you want</li>
      <li>Boil the eggs: boil the yoke color you prefer</li>
      <li>Start plating: I don't think you want to use all your pans</li>
      <li>
        Fry the fish and meat: you can decide to steam or roast; it's all on
        you!
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, during the plating, after adding the grinded cassva leaves, mix it
        with the oil you prefer. I prefer with Red Oil (Palm oil)
      </li>
      <li>Don't forget to add the fish and meat!</li>
      <p>PS: I do hope you added salt as you cooked!</p>
