    <h3>Description</h3>
    Have you wondered how Gob3 pro max is made? Stress not! I'm here to show you
    how it's made.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Riped plantain</li>
      <li>Beans</li>
      <li>Oil: Red or Vegetable</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Cassave Flakes</li>
      <li>Boiled Eggs</li>
      <li>Avocado</li>
      <li>Sausages</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil the beans till it becomes soft: the texture is on you!</li>
      <li>Fry the riped plantain to the texture you want</li>
      <li>Boil the eggs: boil the yoke color you prefer</li>
      <li>Start plating: I don't think you want to use all your pans</li>
      <li>Fry the sausages</li>
      <li>
        Now, during the plating, after adding the boiled beans, mix it with the
        oil you prefer. I prefer with Red Oil (Palm oil)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle some cassva flakes on the oiled beans: the quantity is on you!
      </li>
      <li>Peal the avocado and elegantly slice it as you plate the meal</li>
      <li>Don't forget to add the sausages!</li>
      <p>PS: I do hope you added salt as you cooked!</p>
